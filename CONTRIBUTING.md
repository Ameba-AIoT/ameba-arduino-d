## How to contribute to Ambiot repos - ambpro2_arduino

#### **Find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is for NDA or close source SDK**, and instead to refer to NDA or close source channel.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/ambiot/ambd_arduino/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/ambiot/ambd_arduino/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Update a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub [Pull Request](https://github.com/ambiot/ambd_arduino/pulls) with the patch. 

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please make sure the code is followed the [mbed coding style](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.16/contributing/style.html#coding-style).

#### **Fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Ambiot will generally not be accepted.

#### **Intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [AmebaIoT Open source forum](https://forum.amebaiot.com/) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use the SDK in the [AmebaIoT Open source forum](https://forum.amebaiot.com/).

* Or refer to [FAQ](https://forum.amebaiot.com/c/faq/48), [GitHub WiKi](https://github.com/ambiot/ambd_arduino/wiki), [Ameba homepage](https://www.amebaiot.com/en/ameba-arduino-summary/).

#### **Contribute to the documentation?**

* Current documentation is released in [Ameba homepage](https://www.amebaiot.com/en/ameba-arduino-summary/).
