About PolarSSL files into lwIP PPP support
------------------------------------------

This folder contains some files fetched from the latest BSD release of
the PolarSSL project for ciphers and encryption methods we need for lwIP
PPP support.

The PolarSSL files were cleaned to contain only the necessary struct
fields and functions needed for lwIP.


The PolarSSL API was not changed at all, so if you are already using
PolarSSL you can choose to skip the compilation of the included PolarSSL
library into lwIP:

The following defines are available for flexibility:

LWIP_INCLUDED_POLARSSL_MD4   ; Use lwIP internal PolarSSL for MD4
LWIP_INCLUDED_POLARSSL_MD5   ; Use lwIP internal PolarSSL for MD5
LWIP_INCLUDED_POLARSSL_SHA1  ; Use lwIP internal PolarSSL for SHA1
LWIP_INCLUDED_POLARSSL_DES   ; Use lwIP internal PolarSSL for DES

If set (=1), the default if required by another enabled PPP feature unless
explicitly set to 0, using included lwIP PolarSSL.

If clear (=0), using external PolarSSL.

Undefined if not needed.

Beware of the stack requirements which can be a lot larger if you are not
using our cleaned PolarSSL library.
