The lwIP PPP support is based from pppd 2.4.5 (http://ppp.samba.org) with
huge changes to match code size and memory requirements for embedded devices.

Anyway, pppd has a mature codebase for years and the average commit count
is getting low on their Git repositories, meaning that we can follow what
is happening on their side and merge what is relevant for lwIP.

So, here is the pppd follow up, so that we don't get away too far from pppd.


== Patch fetched from from pppd Debian packages ==

This has nothing to do with pppd, but we merged some good patch from
Debian and this is a good place to be.

- LCP adaptive echo, so that we don't send LCP echo request if we
  are receiving data from peer, can be enabled by setting PPP_LCP_ADAPTIVE
  to true.
 
- IPCP no/replace default route option, were added in the early stage of
  the ppp port, but it wasn't really helpful and was disabled when adding
  the new API ppp_set_default() call, which gives the lwIP user control over
  which one is the default interface, it was actually a requirement if you
  are doing PPP over PPP (i.e. PPPoL2TP, VPN link, over PPPoE, ADSL link).

- using rp-pppoe pppd exits with EXIT_OK after receiving a timeout waiting
  for PADO due to no modem attached, bug reported to pppd bug tracker, fixed
  in Debian but not in the latest (at the time when the port were started)
  pppd release.


== Commits on pppd ==

2010-03-06 - Document +ipv6 and ipv6cp-accept-local
  e7537958aee79b3f653c601e903cb31d78fb7dcc

Don't care.


2010-03-06 - Install pppol2tp plugins with sane permissions
  406215672cfadc03017341fe03802d1c7294b903

Don't care.


2010-03-07 - pppd: Terminate correctly if lcp_lowerup delayed calling
             fsm_lowerup
  3eb9e810cfa515543655659b72dde30c54fea0a5

Merged 2012-05-17.


2010-03-07 - rp_pppoe: Copy acName and pppd_pppoe_service after option parsing
  cab58617fd9d328029fffabc788020264b4fa91f

Don't care, is a patch for pppd/plugins/rp-pppoe/plugin.c which is not part
of the port.


2010-08-23 - set and reset options to control environment variables
             for scripts.
  2b6310fd24dba8e0fca8999916a162f0a1842a84

We can't fork processes in embedded, therefore all the pppd process run
feature is disabled in the port, so we don't care about the new
"environment variables" pppd feature.


2010-08-23 - Nit: use _exit when exec fails and restrict values to 0-255
             per POSIX.
  2b4ea140432eeba5a007c0d4e6236bd0e0c12ba4

Again, we are not running as a heavy process, so all exit() or _exit() calls
were removed.


2010-08-23 - Fix quote handling in configuration files to be more like shell
             quoting.
  3089132cdf5b58dbdfc2daf08ec5c08eb47f8aca

We are not parsing config file, all the filesystem I/O stuff were disabled
in our port.


2010-08-24 - rp-pppoe: allow MTU to be increased up to 1500
  fd1dcdf758418f040da3ed801ab001b5e46854e7

Only concern changes on RP-PPPoE plugin, which we don't use.


2010-09-11 - chat: Allow TIMEOUT value to come from environment variable
  ae80bf833e48a6202f44a935a68083ae52ad3824

See 2b6310fd24dba8e0fca8999916a162f0a1842a84.


2011-03-05 - pppdump: Fix printfs with insufficient arguments
  7b8db569642c83ba3283745034f2e2c95e459423

pppdump is a ppp tool outside pppd source tree.


2012-05-06 - pppd: Don't unconditionally disable VJ compression under Linux
  d8a66adf98a0e525cf38031b42098d539da6eeb6

Patch for sys-linux.c, which we don't use.


2012-05-20 - Remove old version of Linux if_pppol2tp.h
  c41092dd4c49267f232f6cba3d31c6c68bfdf68d

Not in the port.


2012-05-20 - pppd: Make MSCHAP-v2 cope better with packet loss
  08ef47ca532294eb428238c831616748940e24a2

This is an interesting patch. However it consumes much more memory for
MSCHAP and I am not sure if the benefit worth it. The PPP client can
always start the authentication again if it failed for whatever reason.


2012-05-20 - scripts: Make poff ignore extra arguments to pppd
  18f515f32c9f5723a9c2c912601e04335106534b

Again, we are not running scripts.

Again, we are not using the RP-PPPoE plugin.

  845cda8fa18939cf56e60b073f63a7efa65336fc

This is just a patch that adds plugins hooks for IPv6, the plugin interface
was disabled because we don't have .so plugins in embedded.


2012-05-20 - pppd: Enable IPV6 by default and fix some warnings
  0b6118239615e98959f7e0b4e746bdd197533248

Change on Makefile for IPv6, warnings were already cleared during port.


2012-05-20 - contrib: Fix pppgetpass.gtk compilation
  80a8e2ce257ca12cce723519a0f20ea1d663b14a

2012-05-20 - pppd: Eliminate some warnings
  c44ae5e6a7338c96eb463881fe709b2dfaffe568

  398ed2585640d198c53e736ee5bbd67f7ce8168e

is about detaching from the terminal, which is out of the embedded scope.
