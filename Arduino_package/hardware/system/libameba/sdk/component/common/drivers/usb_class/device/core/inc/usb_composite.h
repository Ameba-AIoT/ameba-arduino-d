 * One notion for how to handle Wireless USB devices involves:

 * (b) updates to usb_gadget to include flags "is it wireless",
 *     "is it wired", plus (presumably in a wrapper structure)
 *     bandgroup and PHY info;
 * (c) presumably a wireless_ep wrapping a usb_ep, and reporting
 *     wireless-specific parameters like maxburst and maxsequence;
 * (d) configurations that are specific to wireless links;
 * (e) function drivers that understand wireless configs and will
 *     support wireless for (additional) function instances;
 * (f) a function to support association setup (like CBAF), not
 *     necessarily requiring a wireless adapter;
 * (g) composite device setup that can create one or more wireless
 *     configs, including appropriate association setup support;

 *
 * Configurations are building blocks for gadget drivers structured around
 * function drivers.  Simple USB gadgets require only one function and one
 * configuration, and handle dual-speed hardware by always providing the same
 * functionality.  Slightly more complex gadgets may have more than one
 * single-function configuration at a given speed; or have configurations
 * that only work at one speed.
 *
 * Composite devices are, by definition, ones with configurations which
 * include more than one function.
 *
 * The lifecycle of a usb_configuration includes allocation, initialization
 * of the fields described above, and calling @usb_add_config() to set up
 * internal data and bind it to a specific device.  The configuration's
 * @bind() method is then used to initialize all the functions and then
 * call @usb_add_function() for them.
 *
 * Those functions would normally be independent of each other, but that's
 * not mandatory.  CDC WMC devices are an example where functions often
 * depend on other functions, with some functions subsidiary to others.
 * Such interdependency may be managed in any way, so long as all of the
 * descriptors complete by the time the composite driver returns from
 * its bind() routine.

 *	an IAD, only the first interface of IAD has its entry in the table.
 * @os_desc_n: Number of entries in os_desc_table
 * @bind: Before the gadget can register, all of its functions bind() to the

 *	Note that setting an interface to its current altsetting resets
 *	interface state, and that all interfaces have a disabled state.
 * @get_alt: Returns the active altsetting.  If this is not provided,
 *	then only altsetting zero is supported.
 * @disable: (REQUIRED) Indicates the function should be disabled.  Reasons
 *	include host resetting or reconfiguring the gadget, and disconnection.
 * @setup: Used for interface-specific control requests.
 * @suspend: Notifies functions when the host stops sending USB traffic.
 * @resume: Notifies functions when the host restarts USB traffic.
 * @get_status: Returns function status as a reply to
 *	GetStatus() request when the recipient is Interface.
 * @func_suspend: callback to be called when
 *	SetFeature(FUNCTION_SUSPEND) is reseived
 *
 * A single USB function uses one or more interfaces, and should in most
 * cases support operation at both full and high speeds.  Each function is
 * associated by @usb_add_function() with a one configuration; that function
 * causes @bind() to be called so resources can be allocated as part of
 * setting up a gadget driver.  Those resources include endpoints, which
 * should be allocated using @usb_ep_autoconfig().
 *
 * To support dual speed operation, a function driver provides descriptors
 * for both high and full speed operation.  Except in rare cases that don't
 * involve bulk endpoints, each speed needs different endpoint descriptors.
 *
 * Function drivers choose their own strategies for managing instance data.
 * The simplest strategy just declares it "static', which means the function
 * can only be activated once.  If the function needs to be exposed in more
 * than one configuration at a given speed, it needs to support multiple
 * usb_function structures (one for each configuration).
 *
 * A more complex strategy might encapsulate a @usb_function structure inside
 * a driver-specific instance structure to allows multiple activations.  An
 * example of multiple activations might be a CDC ACM function that supports
 * two or more distinct instances within the same configuration, providing
 * several independent logical data links to a USB host.
